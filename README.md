# Generating-image-annotation-model
BE Final Year project

This solution is for people who are visually impaired where this platform will help them identify their immediate vicinity with ease.

The capt_test folder has images upon which training has been done.
The capt.json has 5 captions each for every image.
The code.py has the code which performs Training on input dataset and does Caption Generation including Text Extraction using Pytesseract library.
The caption that is generated gets converted to audio using a Google API.
